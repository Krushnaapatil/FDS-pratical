// Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle
// Club'. Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted
// membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First
// node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of
// club. Write C++ program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly
// linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
// a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
// b) Compute total number of members of club
// c) Display members
